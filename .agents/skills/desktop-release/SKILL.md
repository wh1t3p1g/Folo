# Desktop Regular Release

Perform a regular desktop release. This skill handles the full release workflow from the `dev` branch.

## Pre-flight checks

1. Confirm the current branch is `dev`. If not, abort with a warning.
2. Run `git pull --rebase` in the repo root to ensure the local branch is up to date.
3. Read `apps/desktop/package.json` to get the current `version` and `mainHash`.

## Step 1: Gather changes since last release

1. Find the last release tag:
   ```bash
   git tag --sort=-creatordate | grep '^desktop/v' | head -1
   ```
2. Get all commits since that tag on the current branch:
   ```bash
   git log <last-tag>..HEAD --oneline --no-merges
   ```
3. Categorize commits into:
   - **Shiny new things** (feat: commits, new features)
   - **Improvements** (refactor:, perf:, chore: improvements, dependency updates)
   - **No longer broken** (fix: commits, bug fixes)
   - **Thanks** (identify external contributor GitHub usernames from commits)

## Step 2: Update changelog

1. Read `apps/desktop/changelog/next.md`.
2. Present the categorized changes to the user and draft the changelog content.
3. Wait for user confirmation or edits before writing.
4. Write the final content to `apps/desktop/changelog/next.md`, following the template format:

   ```markdown
   # What's new in vNEXT_VERSION

   ## Shiny new things

   - description of new feature

   ## Improvements

   - description of improvement

   ## No longer broken

   - description of fix

   ## Thanks

   Special thanks to volunteer contributors @username for their valuable contributions
   ```

5. Keep `NEXT_VERSION` as the placeholder - it will be replaced by `apply-changelog.ts` during bump.

## Step 3: Commit changelog updates before bump

`nbump` requires a clean working tree. Commit changelog edits before running bump.

1. Stage the changelog update:
   ```bash
   git add apps/desktop/changelog/next.md
   ```
2. Commit it on `dev`:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "docs(desktop): prepare release changelog"
   ```
3. If there are no changes to commit, continue without creating an extra commit.

## Step 4: Evaluate mainHash

This is critical for determining whether users need a full app update or can use the lightweight renderer hot update.

1. Check what files changed in `apps/desktop/layer/main/` since the last release tag:
   ```bash
   git diff <last-tag>..HEAD --name-only -- apps/desktop/layer/main/
   ```
2. Also check changes to `apps/desktop/package.json` fields other than version/mainHash (since package.json is included in the hash calculation):
   ```bash
   git diff <last-tag>..HEAD -- apps/desktop/package.json
   ```

**Decision logic:**

- If there are **NO changes** in `layer/main/` and no meaningful `package.json` changes (only version/mainHash/changelog-related), then mainHash should NOT be updated. Users will get a fast renderer-only hot update.
- If there are **trivial changes** in `layer/main/` (typo fixes, comment changes, logging tweaks) that don't affect runtime behavior, recommend NOT updating mainHash. Present the changes to the user and ask for confirmation.
- If there are **meaningful changes** in `layer/main/` (new features, bug fixes, dependency changes, API changes), mainHash MUST be updated. Users will need a full app update.

Present your analysis to the user with:

- List of changed files in `layer/main/`
- A summary of what changed
- Your recommendation (update or skip mainHash)
- Ask for explicit confirmation

## Step 5: Save old mainHash and execute bump

1. Save the current mainHash from `apps/desktop/package.json` for later comparison.
2. Verify working tree is clean before bump:
   ```bash
   git status --short
   ```
3. Change directory to `apps/desktop/` and run the bump:
   ```bash
   cd apps/desktop && pnpm bump
   ```
4. This command will:
   - Pull latest changes
   - Apply changelog (rename next.md to {version}.md, create new next.md)
   - Recalculate mainHash and write to package.json
   - Format package.json
   - Bump minor version
   - Commit with message `release(desktop): release v{NEW_VERSION}`
   - Create branch `release/desktop/{NEW_VERSION}`
   - Push branch and create PR to `main`

## Step 6: Restore mainHash if skipping update

If Step 4 decided mainHash should NOT be updated, restore the old value now. The bump has already committed, pushed, and created the PR on a new release branch, so we amend the commit and force push. This is safe because the release branch was just created.

1. Change back to the repo root first (Step 5 left the working directory at `apps/desktop/`):
   ```bash
   cd ../..
   ```
2. Ensure you are on the `release/desktop/{NEW_VERSION}` branch (bump should have switched to it).
3. Replace the recalculated mainHash with the saved old value in `apps/desktop/package.json`.
4. Stage and amend the release commit:
   ```bash
   git add apps/desktop/package.json && git commit --amend --no-edit
   ```
5. Force push the release branch:
   ```bash
   git push --force origin release/desktop/{NEW_VERSION}
   ```

If Step 4 decided mainHash SHOULD be updated, skip this step entirely — the bump already wrote the correct new value.

## Step 7: Verify

1. Confirm the PR was created successfully by checking the output.
2. Report the new version number and PR URL to the user.
3. Summarize:
   - New version: v{NEW_VERSION}
   - mainHash updated: yes/no (and why)
   - Changelog highlights
   - PR URL
