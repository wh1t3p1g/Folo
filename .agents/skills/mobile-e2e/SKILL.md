# Mobile E2E

Run the mobile Maestro tests for `apps/mobile`.

## Files that matter

- Runner: `apps/mobile/e2e/run-maestro.sh`
- iOS auth flow: `apps/mobile/e2e/flows/ios/auth.yaml`
- Android auth flow: `apps/mobile/e2e/flows/android/core.yaml`
- Shared auth flows: `apps/mobile/e2e/flows/shared/*.yaml`
- Artifacts: `apps/mobile/e2e/artifacts/`

## Always do first

From repo root:

```bash
cd apps/mobile
pnpm run e2e:doctor
pnpm run typecheck
```

## iOS

Use a simulator `.app` build, not an Expo development client.

### Preferred simulator

Prefer the **latest installed iOS runtime** and a **latest-generation iPhone simulator**.

When multiple simulators are available, bias toward the newest iPhone model on the newest installed iOS version.

### Boot simulator

```bash
xcrun simctl boot <IOS_UDID>
xcrun simctl bootstatus <IOS_UDID> -b
open -a Simulator --args -CurrentDeviceUDID <IOS_UDID>
```

### App bundle

`run-maestro.sh` can resolve the app bundle from one of these sources:

- `MAESTRO_IOS_APP_PATH`
- a local `build-*.tar.gz` in `apps/mobile`
- an existing `DerivedData/.../Release-iphonesimulator/Folo.app`

If none of those exist, build one first.

### Build simulator app when missing

If `Folo.app` is not available yet:

```bash
cd apps/mobile/ios
pod install
xcodebuild -workspace Folo.xcworkspace \
  -scheme Folo \
  -configuration Release \
  -sdk iphonesimulator \
  -destination 'id=<IOS_UDID>' \
  build
```

### Apple Silicon simulator optimization

When running on an Apple Silicon Mac and building only for the simulator used in the current run, prefer compiling only the active `arm64` simulator architecture:

```bash
xcodebuild ... \
  ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=YES \
  ARCHS=arm64
```

Use this optimization only for local self-test / e2e simulator builds tied to the current machine. Do not use it when you need a universal simulator app for other machines or when running on Intel Macs.

Expected output pattern:

```bash
~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/.../Build/Products/Release-iphonesimulator/Folo.app
```

### Run iOS auth flow

```bash
cd apps/mobile
MAESTRO_IOS_DEVICE_ID=<IOS_UDID> \
MAESTRO_IOS_APP_PATH=<PATH_TO_Folo.app> \
pnpm run e2e:ios
```

## Android

Use a **release APK**, not an Expo development build.

### Java

Use Android Studio bundled JBR:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home"
export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

### Android SDK

```bash
export ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/Library/Android/sdk"
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT="$HOME/Library/Android/sdk"
```

If `apps/mobile/android/local.properties` is missing, create it with:

```bash
echo "sdk.dir=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk" > apps/mobile/android/local.properties
```

### Build release APK

If `apps/mobile/android` does not exist locally, generate it first with Expo prebuild / run-android tooling.

Then build the release APK:

```bash
cd apps/mobile/android
./gradlew app:assembleRelease --console=plain
```

Expected APK path:

```bash
apps/mobile/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

### Install to emulator

```bash
adb -s emulator-5554 install -r apps/mobile/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

### Run Android auth flow

Start a booted emulator first, then:

```bash
cd apps/mobile
pnpm run e2e:android
```

## Result checks

Successful auth validation means:

- register flow finishes
- sign-out reaches `login-screen`
- login flow makes `login-screen` disappear

## Debugging output

Inspect these folders after a run:

```bash
apps/mobile/e2e/artifacts/ios/
apps/mobile/e2e/artifacts/android/
```

For a one-off focused run, invoke Maestro directly against a single flow and a custom debug directory.
